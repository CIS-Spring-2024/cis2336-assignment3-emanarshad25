For the concept caf√© "Sugar Cafe," an interactive and eye-catching order form is created using the HTML page that is given. The design makes use of a Flexbox style and contemporary web standards like HTML5 and CSS3 to guarantee that information is responsive and centered on various devices. To improve the user experience, the website is organized with an order form in the main area, a thank-you note in the bottom, and a header that extends a warm greeting to visitors. The order form is tidily arranged into a section with a box-shadow and rounded edges inside the main area for a tidy, contemporary appearance. Consumers can choose from 0 to 10 amounts in input areas for a variety of products, such as different kinds of tea, coffee, and pastries. Every format item is styled for clarity and ease of use, with wide, responsive buttons that facilitate interaction, especially on mobile devices. The overall design not only makes the form functional but also contributes to a pleasant user experience, encouraging interaction and order placement.
